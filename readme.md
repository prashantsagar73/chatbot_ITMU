## Installing dependencies

Use of virtualenv is highly recommended, especially since the old version of `nltk` used requires an old version of `setuptools`.

    $ pip install -r requirements.txt

## Setting up chatbot

* run the file Train_chatbot for creating the models

    $ train_chatbot.py
    
* run the file chatbothui for launch the chatbot

    $ train_chatbotgui.py
